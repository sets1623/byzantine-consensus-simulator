# 🛡️ Byzantine Consensus Simulator

A simulation framework for analyzing **Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms** in distributed systems.  
This project models honest and malicious nodes, message passing, and consensus behavior under Byzantine failures.

---

## 📌 Overview

Distributed systems must operate correctly even when some nodes fail or act maliciously.  
Such failures are known as **Byzantine faults**.

The **Byzantine Consensus Simulator** provides a controlled environment to:
- Study consensus behavior under Byzantine conditions
- Experiment with malicious node strategies
- Validate theoretical fault-tolerance limits
- Understand real-world distributed consensus challenges

This project is designed for **education, research, and experimentation**.
